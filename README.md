### 🕹 Game Description

**Echoes of Escape** tells the story of a man overworked and longing for change. His mind is worn thin, and his view of reality has begun to slip. As he attempts to flee his life in the city, he encounters illusions that threaten his mental state, each one chipping away at his fragile sanity. The goal is simple: survive and break free.

### 🎮 Key Gameplay Mechanics
- **Dual Dimensions:** Swap between a 2D and 3D world to navigate through obstacles.
  - **2D Dimension:** The main character encounters illusions. Touching these illusions will decrease his mental stability.
  - **3D Dimension:** Playing as the character's soul, navigate through the spirit world to find the white door that will cleanse the path forward in the real world.
- **Unique Enemy:** A "sanity eater" that pursues the player in the 3D world, making survival even more challenging.

### 🎯 What Makes It Unique?

Echoes of Escape introduces a dimension-shifting mechanic that switches between 2D and 3D gameplay modes. Unlike typical endless runners, this feature creates a unique, immersive experience where the player must adapt to two distinct dimensions to progress.

### 📈 Target Audience

Currently available for PC, *Echoes of Escape* is designed to be accessible and engaging for gamers seeking quick yet challenging gameplay. Ideal for players looking to unwind during breaks, whether on the train or waiting for an appointment. Our future goals include expanding to mobile platforms, adding a more accessible experience for all players.

> ⚠️ **Note:** This game is in development, and gameplay mechanics and other elements are subject to change as we refine the experience.
